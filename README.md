# Loan-Calculator
This Python mini-project calculates the growth of a loan or investment over time, incorporating interest rates, a grace period, and a safety limit. It allows the user to explore multiple scenarios interactively and visualizes the capital evolution using a plot.

Features :
Accepts user input for:
Initial capital (€)
Annual interest rate (%)
Duration of the loan/investment (years)
Safety limit (€)
Grace period (years)
Grace period logic: during the grace period, interest is not applied.
Automatic stop if the capital exceeds the safety limit.
Visualizes the growth of capital over time with a matplotlib line plot.
Handles multiple scenarios in a single program run.

How to Run :
Clone or download the repository.
Make sure you have Python installed (recommended: Python 3.8+).

Install matplotlib if not already installed:
pip install matplotlib

Run the program:
python loan_calculator.py
Enter the requested inputs and observe the output and plot.
